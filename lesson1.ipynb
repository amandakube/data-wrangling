    "## Lesson 1, Introduction & Visualizing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Data Wrangling.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course will primarily use Jupyter Notebook, an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, narrative text, and many other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Python libraries will be an important part of the course. Libraries are a collection of functions and methods that let you perform actions without writing code, since the code is already written for you. Libraries can be a difficult concept to understand, so feel free to use the internet to gain a better understanding of what they are. In order to have all the python libraries required for the course, go to your Anaconda Navigator, click on Environments, click on the arrow next to \"base(root)\", and click \"Open Terminal\". Once your terminal is open, type in the following commands after each one is installed: \n",
    "\n",
    "* pip install pandas\n",
    "* pip install numpy\n",
    "* pip install matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can simply open a Terminal window (Mac OS/Unix) from your Applications folder or a command prompt (Windows) and run the same commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Jupyter Notebook Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook executes code within cells. This is convenient because it gives you the ability to run cells individually, all together at once, or in several other variations. You should see an empty cell below this text cell - all cells will have \"In[]:\" to the left of it. Inside the bracket you will typically either see a number, an asterisk, or nothing. A number indicates the chronological order in which a cell was run, an asterisk means the cell is currently running, and a blank bracket means the cell is yet to be run. In Jupyter Notebook, cells will run individually if you just click \"Run\" (or Shift + Enter) while the cell is in focus, and will not reference any other cell unless another cell was run before it. For instance, if you import a python library in one cell and run it, and then use the library in another cell to compute an equation, the equation will execute with no problem. However, if you import a library but do NOT run the cell, the library will not be imported and any cell referencing that library will not succesfully execute because the library cannot be found. To get around this issue, simply click on \"Cell\" at the top of the notebook, and \"Run All\". \n",
